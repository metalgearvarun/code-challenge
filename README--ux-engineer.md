# üóÇÔ∏è UX Engineer Take-Home Challenge

## Build a Folder Grid in React + TypeScript

### üß≠ Overview

This challenge is focused on building a responsive Folder Grid interface in React using TypeScript. It's designed to evaluate your skills in component architecture, styling, interaction design, and system-level thinking.

You'll be working in a preconfigured CodeSandbox environment that includes folder data and an icon system. Your task is to design and implement a reusable FolderGrid UI.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Instructions

1. Fork the CodeSandbox and implement your solution.
   - All dependencies and mock data are included‚Äîno setup required
   - Feel free to download the challenge and work in your preferred editor
2. Add a short summary in the CodeSandbox description with:
   - Assumptions or decisions you made
   - Anything unfinished (if applicable)
3. Be prepared to walk us through your approach and code

### üìÅ Provided Files

#### `public/data.json`

This file contains the mock data for the folder grid:

- Object with `files` and `folders` properties
- Each folder has properties like `fileIds`, `name`, `isPrivate`, `created`, `updated`
- Each file has properties like `name`, `type`, `created`, `updated`
- The data structure is fully typed with TypeScript interfaces in `src/types.ts`

#### `src/theme.ts`

This file provides the design system configuration:

- Color palette and typography settings
- Spacing and layout constants
- Animation timing and easing functions
- Responsive breakpoints
- Shadow and z-index configurations

#### `src/components/icon.tsx`

This file contains the icon component system:

- Reusable Icon component with TypeScript props interface
- Integration with Phosphor React icons
- Support for different sizes, colors, and weights

#### `src/types.ts`

This file contains TypeScript type definitions:

- `FolderData` interface for folder metadata
- `FileData` interface for file metadata
- `Data` interface for the complete data structure
